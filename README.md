#Tetris VB6
Tetris built in VB6 - Com Sci Final Project

Beware, this program may have bugs and it seems like a side effect of constantly redrawing the field is causing high CPU usuage.

This project is slightly different compared to the one found on my site, that version can be found in the "final" branch.

The application can be found here: [Tetris VB6 v1.0](https://github.com/ktsuench/tetrisvb6/releases/tag/v1.0)
